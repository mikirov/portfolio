# ZeroTrustVault Integration Project

## Overview

[ZeroTrustVault](https://zerotrustvault.xyz/) is a decentralized escrow solution that leverages zero-knowledge (ZK) proofs to verify computational conditions, ensuring trustless, private, and cryptographically secure transactions. It employs the RISC Zero zkVM for executing general-purpose computations while generating ZK proofs, enhancing privacy and security in high-value interactions. 

## My Role

As a Blockchain Security Engineer, I led the integration of ZeroTrustVault into our client's transaction processing system. My responsibilities included:

- **Protocol Implementation**: Integrated ZeroTrustVault's decentralized escrow protocol to facilitate secure transactions between parties.

- **Zero-Knowledge Proofs**: Utilized RISC Zero zkVM to implement ZK proofs, ensuring that transaction conditions are verified without exposing sensitive information.

- **Fallback Mechanism Development**: Established a DAO-based dispute resolution system to handle cases where ZK proofs could not be supplied, ensuring decentralized and transparent decision-making.

## Key Achievements

- **Enhanced Security**: Achieved a trustless and immutable transaction environment, reducing reliance on traditional intermediaries.

- **Cost Efficiency**: Lowered transaction fees by implementing smart contracts, providing a cost-effective solution compared to centralized alternatives.

- **Scalability**: Leveraged Groth16 proof system for efficient on-chain proof verification, optimizing gas costs and enabling broader adoption.

## Technologies Used

- **Blockchain Platforms**: Ethereum

- **Smart Contract Languages**: Solidity

- **Zero-Knowledge Proof Systems**: RISC Zero zkVM, Groth16

- **Development Tools**: Truffle, Hardhat, Remix IDE

## Outcome

The integration of ZeroTrustVault provided our client with a robust and transparent system for high-value transactions, ensuring privacy, security, and efficiency. The decentralized escrow solution mitigated risks associated with traditional intermediaries, fostering trust and reliability in the client's operations.

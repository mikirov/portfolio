# Histori - Historical Blockchain Data

## **Problem: The Challenge of Accessing Historical Blockchain Data**

In the rapidly evolving world of blockchain, developers and businesses alike face a significant challenge: accessing **reliable**, **affordable**, and **scalable** blockchain data, particularly historical data. As blockchain technology becomes more integral to decentralized systems and applications, this data is crucial for various use cases such as token balance tracking, portfolio management, compliance, and auditing.

### **Key Pain Points:**

1. **Running Costly Archival Nodes**:
    - To access historical blockchain data, one common solution is to run a fully-synced **archival node**, which requires **terabytes of storage** (4-12 TB depending on the network) and takes **multiple days** or weeks to synchronize. This approach is technically demanding, time-consuming, and expensive, especially for businesses needing reliable, up-to-date data across multiple blockchain networks.
2. **Navigating Public Blockchain Services**:
    - While some public services provide blockchain data, they often impose significant limitations, including rate limits, unreliable uptime, and inconsistent query performance. These services can become costly as usage scales, with unpredictable response times and incomplete data coverage.
3. **Building Custom Scrapers**:
    - Crafting custom scripts to scrape blockchain data is another common solution. However, building these scrapers involves writing and maintaining complex code to fetch, parse, and store data. This approach often leads to **inconsistent results**, breaks during blockchain updates, and high operational overhead in terms of both development and infrastructure.
4. **Inability to Efficiently Access Historical Data**:
    - Questions like "What was my client’s token balance at block Y?" are critical for portfolio managers, traders, wallet providers, and DeFi projects, but they are **challenging to answer at scale**. Historical data is often scattered, incomplete, or difficult to retrieve efficiently across multiple blockchain networks. Traditional methods of querying this data are inefficient, particularly when dealing with large datasets.

### **Impact on Developers and Businesses**:

These challenges slow down development in the Web3 space, making it difficult for developers to build decentralized applications (dApps) that require historical blockchain data. The high cost, complexity, and unreliability of current solutions deter businesses from scaling or fully realizing the potential of blockchain technology. For blockchain adoption to accelerate, there needs to be a solution that makes accessing historical data fast, affordable, and reliable.

## **Solution: How Histori Solves the Problem**

At **Histori**, we are addressing these challenges by offering a **RESTful API** that provides developers with **fast**, **reliable**, and **affordable** access to historical blockchain data without the need to manage costly infrastructure or write custom scraping code.

### **How Histori Achieves This:**

1. **Efficient Access to Historical Data**:
    - Histori allows developers to effortlessly query historical data such as token balances, approvals, allowances, and contract details at specific blocks. Whether it's fetching an ERC20 token balance at a specific block height or querying a list of token holders at a given moment, developers can achieve this with simple API calls. This reduces the complexity of interacting with blockchain nodes directly and eliminates the need for large-scale infrastructure.
2. **Seamless Integration via API**:
    - Instead of running and maintaining a full archival node, developers can use the **Histori API** to request the data they need. By modifying parameters like `network_name` or `block_number` in the API URL, users can instantly fetch data from different blockchain networks without any extra overhead. This reduces the technical burden of building and maintaining custom infrastructure.
    - Example API call:
        
        ```bash
        https://api.histori.xyz/v1/eth-mainnet/tokens?token_type=erc20
        
        ```
2. **Affordability and Accessibility**:
    - With a pricing structure that ranges from a **free trial** to higher-tier plans (Starter, Growth, Business, and Enterprise), **Histori** ensures that developers of all sizes—from individual projects to large enterprises—can access historical blockchain data without breaking the bank. The platform offers competitive pricing, which makes it far more cost-effective than maintaining private nodes or using traditional data providers with unpredictable costs.
3. **Standardized Request and Response Formats**:
    - The Histori API provides standardized data formats that are easy to work with, allowing developers to integrate blockchain data into their applications with minimal effort. This standardization reduces the complexity of dealing with raw blockchain data and ensures consistent responses, regardless of the network being queried.
4. **Reduced Setup Time**:
    - Instead of waiting days or weeks for a node to sync, developers can instantly access historical data via API. This dramatically shortens the time to market for projects that need to integrate blockchain data and allows businesses to move faster without the bottlenecks caused by traditional methods.

### **Use Cases for the Histori API**:

1. **Portfolio Managers**:
    - Easily fetch historical token balances and transactions at specific block heights to track portfolio performance or conduct audits.
2. **Wallet Providers**:
    - Provide users with real-time historical data on their token holdings, approvals, and allowances without requiring expensive infrastructure.
3. **DeFi Projects**:
    - Retrieve token transfer and balance data at specific points in time to power decentralized finance applications, perform analytics, or audit smart contracts.
4. **Blockchain Analytics**:
    - Leverage historical blockchain data to build powerful analytical tools, dashboards, and reports that offer insights into token flows, holder distributions, and on-chain activity.

# Histori

Histori is a pioneering tech startup focused on providing seamless access to historical blockchain data across multiple networks. The platform was designed to simplify blockchain data retrieval through a robust REST API and an intuitive SDK, both of which empower developers and organizations to access and analyze historical blockchain insights with minimal effort. By abstracting the complexity of managing and querying historical blockchain data, Histori allows users to focus on leveraging data to drive insights, decisions, and innovations without needing to build or maintain their own blockchain infrastructure.

Histori's services are accessible through our main website at [histori.xyz](https://histori.xyz), with extensive developer documentation provided at [docs.histori.xyz](https://docs.histori.xyz) to support users at all levels. For high-demand users and enterprise solutions, we offer enhanced features enabling integration through a dedicated node interface at [node.histori.xyz](https://node.histori.xyz). This setup facilitates efficient interaction with Ethereum RPC nodes and additional supported networks, ensuring that Histori is both versatile and scalable to meet diverse user needs.

Histori is a tribute to the blockchain industry, honoring the impact and potential of decentralized technology by addressing a core need in the ecosystem: easily accessible, historical blockchain data. As the blockchain industry matures, historical data becomes increasingly valuable for auditing, research, financial analysis, and compliance purposes. Histori positions itself as a critical tool for developers and enterprises who require reliable access to this data.

## My Role as Founder

As the Founder of Histori, I led the project from concept to launch, steering both its strategic direction and technical implementation. My involvement encompassed a wide range of responsibilities:

1. **Product Vision and Architecture**  
   At the outset, I defined the vision for Histori, identifying the need for accessible blockchain data as a key driver in our solution. My role involved architecting the platform to support multiple blockchain networks, focusing on scalability, reliability, and user-friendly integration. This vision informed every part of the project, from backend development to tokenomics, ensuring Histori would serve as a versatile, high-performance solution for users in the blockchain space.

2. **Tokenomics and Smart Contract Design**  
   To create value and incentivize adoption, I designed and developed the Histori (HST) ERC20 token. The HST token is governed by a 2% annual inflation model, ensuring the total supply reaches 10 million over a decade. I incorporated mechanisms for token deposits, enabling users to commit tokens without allowing withdrawals, thereby aligning incentives with data access. Additionally, I structured token allocations to reward early adopters and structured an ICO plan to fund future development.

3. **API Gateway and AWS Infrastructure**  
   Histori relies on a robust AWS-based infrastructure to deliver seamless access and efficient request management. I configured AWS API Gateway to handle complex request flows, enabling features such as path parameters for specifying networks, custom domain setup, and flexible API key management for tracking usage. This approach provided a scalable infrastructure capable of handling high request volumes while maintaining security and access control.

4. **Backend Development with NestJS**  
   I led the development of Histori’s backend service using NestJS, integrating several essential features to deliver reliable service. This included calls to external APIs to fetch live ETH prices and HST-to-ETH prices, allowing our service to calculate the USD price of HST tokens dynamically. I also implemented balance and tier management, using a TypeORM entity to track user balances and automate tier assignments based on predefined thresholds. Furthermore, I developed the service to use a user entity based on the `web3Address` field, creating new users via the `authService` if they didn't exist, and associating API keys with subscription plans.

5. **Event Processing and Security**  
   Histori’s platform includes event-driven processing to handle user deposits and staking activities. I implemented an event-processing framework that waits 10 minutes after deposit events, fetches event details again, and then processes the event. Additionally, I incorporated reorg protection by waiting for 50 confirmations before processing transactions, using the latest version of ethers.js. This setup ensures transaction integrity and addresses potential blockchain reorganization risks.

6. **User Tier and Subscription Management**  
   To manage user tiers and subscription statuses, I implemented a cron job to handle daily tier demotion, ensuring users are automatically downgraded if their subscription lapses. Additionally, I developed a mapping system for tier assignments based on user balances, including a property that indicates when the current subscription ends. This tier structure helps users access data at levels proportional to their subscription while maintaining a smooth and automated user experience.

7. **Customer Onboarding and Airdrop Eligibility**  
   To streamline user onboarding and promote adoption, I designed a private QR code scan URL for onboarding users directly into our airdrop eligibility flow. This approach allows users to join with minimal setup by simply scanning the code, entering a signature validation flow, and linking their wallet. This system enables users to be eligible for airdrops without additional code or manual verification, making the onboarding experience faster and more user-friendly.

8. **Marketing and Industry Positioning**  
   Throughout Histori's development, I worked to position the platform within the blockchain industry as a valuable resource for developers, researchers, and organizations. Our focus on delivering historical blockchain data is both timely and essential as the industry grows and data becomes more critical. By designing Histori as a tribute to the blockchain industry, I underscored our dedication to decentralization, transparency, and data accessibility.

## Conclusion

In leading Histori, I developed an end-to-end solution that simplifies access to historical blockchain data, aligning our product with the industry's growing need for reliable and scalable data solutions. From infrastructure and tokenomics to onboarding and event processing, I ensured that Histori’s architecture, features, and user experience align with our mission to make blockchain data accessible, practical, and user-friendly for a broad range of users and applications.

This project gave me the opportunity to work on a AAA game and gain these skills:
- Experience working in a big team on a large codebase with tight deadlines.
- Worked on prototyping, implementing, testing and debugging various features for the latest DLC



## I personally worked on:
- Main character skills and abilities
- Inventory
- Fight system
- Fixing various bugs for the game
